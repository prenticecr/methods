This repo includes survey data from 2013 and 2021 collected by the research team and analyzed for our manuscript entitled, "Taking care of business and doing overtime: Teaching research methods in public affairs curricula pre-pandemic and during COVID-19" (Under Review)

In this research, we sought to better understand important trends and developments in the teaching of quantitative and research methods courses in graduate public affairs programs. We were specifically interested in the following areas related to the teaching of quantitative and research methods: the impact of new technologies on curriculum delivery; the content of courses related to statistical analysis and research design; and the importance of numeracy, ethics, and data visualization. We surveyed quantitative and research methods instructors in graduate public affairs programs using the same survey instrument at two intervals eight years apart and analyzed results from each period side-by-side. Findings indicate some stark differences in the content and delivery of these courses. Given the timing of the second survey – Spring 2021 – findings are considered within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data are for the exclusive use of the research team and are made available in this public repo for the purposes of peer review.
